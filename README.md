# Community Health

## Overview

This repository provides default community health files, such as LICENSE and ISSUE_TEMPLATES.
Default files will be used for any repository that owned by this account that does not contain its own file of that type.

See <https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/creating-a-default-community-health-file>.

## Issue and Pull Request templates

Issue and pull request templates customize and standardize the information you'd like contributors to include when they open issues and pull requests in your repository. For more information, see [About issue and pull request templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates).

If an issue template sets a label, that label must be created in your .github repository and any repositories where the template will be used.
