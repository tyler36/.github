## Create an Issue

If you find a bug in this project, or stumble following documentation, or have a question, create an Issue.
An Issue becomes the first step towards resolution while also encouraging others to share and contribute too.
This project includes a couple of templates to help you. For more information on how issues work, check out GitHub's [Issues guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/about-issues).

### Issue Pro Tips

- **Search for similar issues**. This helps reduce duplicate issue. Remember to check opened and closed issues. There's a chance someone may have posted a solution, or provided that vital configuration setting that you may have overlooked.
- **Follow a template**. This process helps focus your thoughts on what you did and what you expected to happen. If you can not provide steps to reproduce the problem, chances are we can not either.
- **Be specific and exact**. Tell us exact version numbers of the software, the exact URL you visited, the exact text you enter into the form, the exact error message displayed. These all help us to replicate the environment, and provide a basis for automated testing.
- **Provide additional information, if possible**. Add links to similar issues, provide screenshots if appropriate, or provide the links to an online repository or CodePen that replicates the problem.
